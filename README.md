# Cribl LogStream on Amazon
> This Quick Start guide was created by [Cribl](https://cribl.io) to help automate the deployment of Cribl LogStream in your AWS environment. These  automated reference deployments use AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy EC2 instances, IAM policies and S3 buckets, following AWS best practices. 

## Overview 
Cribl has put together a simple method to launch a CloudFormation template that will automatically create the IAM EC2 role and the proper IAM policy to use with your deployment. We will be breaking down the permissions used, AWS resources deployed and their associated costs. 

## Architecture 
Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters will build a single EC2 instance within the default VPC and create an S3 bucket that can be used as a source or destination. The EC2 Role with the associated policy will also be created as a part of this CloudFormation template.

_Figure 1: Cribl LogStream Single Instance architecture deployment in AWS_

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start CloudFormation template sets up the following:

* In AWS: 
   * EC2 Instance
   * Security Group
   * S3 Bucket
   * IAM Role and Policy

## Cost and licenses

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Quick Start reference deployment. There are not additional costs for using the Quick Start. The Cribl LogStream license included in your deployment will default to the LogStream Free 1TB license. For more information about licensing, please refer to the [Cribl LogStream Pricing Page](https://cribl.io/cribl-logstream-pricing/).

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings may affect the cost of your deployment. For cost estimates, see our estimates under "Pricing Information" in the AWS Marketplace listing. 

> Estimated Infrastructure Cost assuming US East (N.Virginia) and a C5.2xlarge instance is $256.88/month. Prices may different depending on instance type, region and other factors. Please check with your AWS billing reports or use the [AWS Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to more accuratly predict your costs. 

## Planning the deployment

### Specialized knowledge
This Quick Start assumes familiarity with Amazon EC2, S3, IAM, Kinesis and CloudFormation. 

### AWS Account
If you don't already have an AWS Account, create one at https://aws.amazon.com and follow the instructions.

## Deployment options
This Quick Start provides two options:
- [Cribl LogStream Single Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08BRGFJK1?qid=1604503537874&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title) 
   - This will deploy a single EC2 instance and configure the AWS services and resources listed above. We will be using this deployment for our quick start guide. 
- [Cribl LogStream Distributed](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08CRVQWCJ?qid=1604503537874&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_title) 
   - This optional deployment can be used if you want to deploy additional worker nodes to process larger volumes of data. 

## Deployment Steps
1. Sign into your AWS Account.

2. Navigate to [Cribl LogStream Single Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08BRGFJK1?qid=1604503537874&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title) and then click on "Continue to Subscribe." 

3. Subscribe to the software and accept the Terms and Conditions. Then click on the "Continue to Configuration." 

4. Configure your deployment, selecting your Deliver Method, Software Version and Region. Click "Continue to Launch."

5. Launch this software using "Launch CloudFormation" in the drop down, then click "Launch". 

6. Log into Cribl LogStream with the credential supplied in the "Outputs" tab on your CloudFormation stack.
   
### CloudFormation Steps

- Step 1 - Specify Template 
      - This will take you to your AWS Account and drop you in a CloudFormation Stack deploy screen. Click "Next" to start the stack creation.

- Step 2 - Specify stack details 

> Tips for deploying in your AWS Environment. If this is a new AWS account, you will need to create the following components: 
> - An SSH Key pair to log into your EC2 instance. Please follow [this guide for help on creating your key pair.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
> - A VPC with publicly accessible IP's. Here is a [CloudFormation template that will create the VPC for you.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fquick-start-cribl.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvpc-flow-create.yaml&stackName=cribl-vpc&param_ClassB=0) 
> - A Subnet ID. This will be created by using the CloudFormation template above.

> Security Group CIDR Tips. 
> - Web Access CIDR should be open to either a range of IP's that you want to grant access. You can also open it to the world if you do not have any restrictions for public access to the webport. An example CIDR would be 0.0.0.0/0.
> - SSH Access CIDR should be closed to your own IP address or a small range of IP's that you want to allow SSH access to your system. An example CIDR for your own IP would be <your_ip_here>/32 where [your IP Address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) would be placed in the <your_ip_here>. 
> - Advanced Settings amild is only used if you are issued this by Cribl Support.
   
   - Step 3 Configure stack options
      - This step has some optional sections. All the defaults can be left as-is and you can click "Next." 
      - You can modify the options in this section if you know what you're doing or have a company policy around tagging AWS resources. 

   - Step 4 Review
      - Review all the steps, acknowledge the access capabilities at the bottom of this page and click "Create Stack." 
Once the CloudFormation stack has been created, click on the Outputs tab of your Stack and you will see the LogStream WebAccess Credentials, the URL and the stackname. Your WebURL 

## Log into Cribl LogStream

Navigate to http://<cribl_logstream_ip>:9000 and log in using admin / <ec2_instance_id> . Once you have logged into your instance take a look around and we can start diving into the use cases.

### Use Cases

- [Send Data to S3 bucket](steps/s3bucket.md)
- [VPC Flow Logs to Metrics](steps/vpcflowlogs2metrics.md)
- [Transform Splunk HEC to S2S](steps/splunkhecS2S.md)
