== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* Can I deploy this solution in a different region other than *us-west-2* ? 

*A.* Yes, you can deploy in other regions that are supported in the regions listed in this document. To change the region, make sure to select the new region in the CloudFormation drop down in the AWS Console. Then, in the CloudFormation template itself, make sure to specify the region that you selected. 

*Q.* Can I modify the EC2 IAM Policy to include other S3 buckets, Kinesis Streams or other AWS resources for my instance to access? 

*A.* Yes, you can modify the EC2 IAM Policy to include other resources you want the Cribl LogStream instance to access. Please refer to https://docs.cribl.io/logstream/sources-s3#s3-and-sqs-permissions for S3 / SQS permissions and https://docs.cribl.io/logstream/sources-kinesis-streams#authentication for Kinesis permissions.

*Q.* Should I set the *AdditionalPolicies* in the template to?
*A.* You can leave this section blank, however if you want you can also set this to *arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore,arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy* . 

== Troubleshooting

Make sure to select TWO Availability Zones (AZ) for your deployment. Selecting one will cause the template to fail.

If your leader gets terminiated, a new leader node will be spawned by the Autoscale Group. The *admin* password will change and will be the *new* instnace_id of the deployment. Simply use that password to log into your Cribl LogStream Leader Node. Additionally, you can now use a git repo to backup your configurations.
