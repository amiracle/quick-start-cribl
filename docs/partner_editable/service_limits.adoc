Use this Quick Start to automatically setup the following architecture on AWS:
A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
An Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group with a configurable number of instances.
An S3 bucket to collect and send data for Cribl LogStream
An EC2 IAM role granting proper rights to the data available in the AWS account
*  The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.
