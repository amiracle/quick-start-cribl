# Push Events to HTTP Endpoint Using Lambda Function

## Finish AWS Setup
Once your VPC has been created, then click on this link to setup VPC Flow logging to a CloudWatch Log Group: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fquickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/cftemplates/%2Fvpc-flow-logs.yaml&stackName=cribl-vpcflow-logs-create&param_ParentVPCStack=cribl-vpc&param_RetentionInDays=1&param_TrafficType=ALL


After deploying our Cribl Distributed Deployment, we will create an HTTP source and generate a token for this source. Once we have that information, then we will setup our AWS environment. We will start with creating a VPC and enable VPC Flow Logs to be sent to a CloudWatch Log Group. From there, we will create a Lambda Function that will trigger on CloudWatch Logs. This will send the events over HTTP into our Cribl LogStream deployment. 

### Cribl LogStream Setup
Log into your Cribl LogStream instance:

![Step-1 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-07.png)

- Go to __Default Group__ -> _Data_ -> _Sources_: 

![Step-2 Add Source](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-08.png)

- Select __Splunk HEC__ source:

![Step-3 Select Splunk HEC](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-09.png)

- Click Add New:

![Step-4 Create new HEC Endpoint](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-10.png)

- Click _Generate_ and get the token:

![Step-7 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-13.png)

- Copy the token and give it a description: 

![Step-8 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-14.png)

- Add the following fields and then click _Save_

Name | Value
--- | ---
sourcetype | 'aws:cloudtrail'
index | main
--- 

![Step-9 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-15.png)


- Now you should have an endpoint ready to collect data from AWS:

### AWS Setup Overview
We are going to create the following components in your AWS Environment:
- VPC with VPC Flow Logs enabled and sending to CloudWatch Logs Group
    - IAM Roles that can write from VPC to CloudWatch Logs
- Lambda function to send data to Cribl HTTP endpoint
    - Create and enable trigger from CloudWatch logs trigger

#### VPC Creation 
> Click on the following CloudFormation template to create a VPC within your AWS Deployment: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fquickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/cftemplates/%2Fvpc-flow-create.yaml&stackName=cribl-vpc&param_ClassB=0.
>
>
>Once this stack is complete, then click on this link to setup VPC Flow logging: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fquickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/cftemplates/%2Fvpc-flow-logs.yaml&stackName=cribl-vpcflow-logs-create&param_ParentVPCStack=cribl-vpc&param_RetentionInDays=1&param_TrafficType=ALL 
> 
> Check your CloudWatch Log Group and make sure the log group exists.

#### Lambda Function Creation

- Click on Create Function in the AWS Lambda console:

![Step-1 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-01.png)

- Click on _Use a Blueprint_ then search for __splunk__ in the search box. Select the _splunk-cloudwatch-logs-processor_ function:

![Step-2 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-03.png)

- Give the function a name, for example _CloudWatchToHTTP_ and leave the default __Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions__

![Step-3 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-04.png)

- Select your CloudWatch Log group to trigger off of, in this example its _vpcflowlogs_, set the filter name to _vpcflowlogs_ and leave the filter pattern blank. 

![Step-4 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-05.png)

- Set your SPLUNK_HEC_URL and SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN to your Cribl instance:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| SPLUNK_HEC_URL | http://cribl_instance:8088/services/collector |
| SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN | 11111111 |

> 
> Replace cribl_instance with your instance's IP Address
> 
> Replace 111111111 with your HEC token
> 
> Click Create function

![Step-5 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-06.png)

- Click on CloudWatch Logs and make sure they are set to _Enabled_:

![Step-6 Lambda](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-20.png)

![Step-11 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-32.png)

- Under filter type _sourcetype=='aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow'_ 
- Under __Metrics__ add :

__Event Field Name__ | __Metric Name Expression__
--- | ---
bytes | 'net.bytes'
packets | 'net.packets'

- Under Dimensions type in : 
    > !_* !end !start *  â€“ which basically means create dimensions out of all fields except for those start with _ (underscore), end and start.
    >

![Step-11 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-33.png)

- Click on _+ Add Function_ and type _Eval_
- Under filter type _sourcetype=='aws:cloudwatchlogs:vpcflow'_
- Under _Evaluate Fields_ Type in _index_ and _'metrics_test'_ 

![Step-11 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-34.png)

- Review your routes:
- All your Cribl Logs are going to S3 and your vpcflow logs are first going to S3 and the metrics are going to Splunk. 

![Step-11 Log into LogStream](https://quickstart-cribl-logstream.s3.amazonaws.com/screenshots/lambda/cls-lambda-36.png)

- Log into your Splunk instance and go to the Analytics dashboard. You should be seeing your VPCFlow Metric data flowing into the metric_test metric index.
